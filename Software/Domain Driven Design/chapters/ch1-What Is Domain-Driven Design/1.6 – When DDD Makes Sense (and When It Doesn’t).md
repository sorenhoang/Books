# Topic 1.6 – When DDD Makes Sense (and When It Doesn’t)

## 1. Core Principle

**Domain-Driven Design is not a default choice.
It is a *strategic investment* that must be justified by domain complexity.**

> 👉 **DDD pays off only when the cost of misunderstanding the business is higher than the cost of modeling it.**

This topic is about **architectural judgment**, not dogma.

---

## 2. When DDD Makes Sense (Strong Signals)

### 2.1 High Business Complexity (Primary Signal)

DDD is appropriate when:

* business rules are nuanced
* edge cases dominate
* policies evolve frequently
* “it depends” is a common answer

Examples:

* Finance / Banking
* Insurance
* Logistics & supply chain
* Healthcare
* Marketplaces
* SaaS with complex pricing & contracts

If the domain complexity is high, **ignoring DDD creates hidden risk**.

---

### 2.2 The Domain Is a Competitive Advantage

DDD makes sense when:

* the domain logic differentiates your product
* competitors cannot easily copy it
* success depends on better decisions, not faster CRUD

This is the **Core Domain** concept (Chapter 2).

---

### 2.3 Long-Lived Systems

DDD shines when:

* the system will live for years
* requirements evolve
* teams rotate
* knowledge continuity matters

DDD is **future-focused**, not feature-focused.

---

### 2.4 Multiple Teams or Organizational Complexity

When:

* many teams touch the same domain
* ownership is unclear
* concepts drift across teams

Strategic DDD (Bounded Contexts) becomes essential.

---

### 2.5 Cost of Failure Is High

DDD is justified when:

* bugs have legal, financial, or reputational impact
* mistakes are expensive to fix
* correctness matters more than speed

---

## 3. When DDD Probably Does *Not* Make Sense

### 3.1 Pure CRUD / Data-Centric Systems

If:

* business rules are minimal
* workflows are straightforward
* the system mostly stores & retrieves data

Examples:

* Admin panels
* CMS
* Internal tools
* Reporting dashboards

Using full DDD here is **ceremony without value**.

---

### 3.2 Short-Lived or Experimental Products

If:

* the product may be discarded
* market fit is unknown
* speed trumps correctness

Then:

* simpler architectures win
* YAGNI applies

DDD can be introduced later **if the domain proves complex**.

---

### 3.3 Immature Teams or Organizations

DDD requires:

* strong communication
* engineering discipline
* willingness to learn the business
* patience

If the organization:

* resists collaboration
* values speed over understanding
* treats engineers as implementers only

DDD adoption will likely fail.

---

## 4. The Gray Zone (Where Most Teams Live)

Most systems are **mixed**:

* some complex parts
* some simple parts

DDD does **not** require:

* everything to be modeled deeply
* every service to use aggregates

Rule:

> **Apply DDD selectively, where it matters.**

This leads to:

* Core Domain → DDD
* Supporting domains → simpler approaches
* Generic domains → off-the-shelf solutions

---

## 5. Partial DDD Is Dangerous (Important Warning)

### 5.1 Tactical DDD Without Strategic DDD

Common mistake:

* rich aggregates
* no clear boundaries
* unclear ownership

Results:

* over-engineering
* coupling
* frustration

---

### 5.2 Strategic DDD Without Tactical Discipline

Opposite mistake:

* beautiful context maps
* weak models inside contexts

Results:

* shallow domain understanding
* procedural code
* slow evolution

DDD works **only as a coherent discipline**.

---

## 6. Cost Model (Senior-Level Thinking)

DDD costs:

* time
* learning effort
* collaboration overhead
* initial delivery speed

DDD pays off in:

* reduced rework
* safer changes
* better alignment
* long-term velocity

Senior question:

> **Will this system still be evolving in 2–3 years?**

If yes → DDD is likely worth it.

---

## 7. Real-World Example

### Misapplied DDD

* Simple CRUD app
* Heavy aggregates
* Domain events everywhere
* Slow development

Outcome:

> Team abandons DDD, blames the methodology.

---

### Correctly Applied DDD

* Complex pricing logic modeled deeply
* Simple user management kept lightweight
* Clear boundaries

Outcome:

> Focused complexity, high ROI.

---

## 8. Senior Engineer Decision Checklist

Ask these before adopting DDD:

* Is the domain complex *and* evolving?
* Is correctness critical?
* Will knowledge continuity matter?
* Are domain experts accessible?
* Can the team invest in learning?

If most answers are **yes**, DDD is appropriate.

---

## 9. Mindset Summary

* DDD is not ideology
* DDD is not free
* DDD is not universal

DDD is:

> **A deliberate response to business complexity.**
