# Topic 1.5 – Collaboration: Engineers & Domain Experts

## 1. Core Concept

**Domain-Driven Design is a socio-technical discipline.
If collaboration fails, DDD fails — regardless of architecture or code quality.**

At its core:

> 👉 **DDD assumes that no single role fully understands the domain — knowledge must be co-created.**

This is not a “soft skill add-on”.
It is **structural to the design itself**.

---

## 2. Who Is a Domain Expert (And Who Is Not)

### Domain Expert ≠ Product Owner ≠ Business Analyst

A **Domain Expert** is:

* someone who makes real business decisions
* understands edge cases and exceptions
* feels the pain when things go wrong
* knows *why* rules exist, not just *what* they are

Examples:

* Operations manager
* Risk analyst
* Claims adjuster
* Senior salesperson
* Fraud investigator

👉 Titles don’t matter. **Decision authority does.**

---

## 3. The Traditional Failure Mode

Most organizations follow this flow:

```
Business → Requirements → Documents → Developers → Code
```

Problems:

* knowledge is translated multiple times
* nuance is lost at each step
* assumptions are frozen too early
* feedback loops are slow

Result:

> **The system reflects the documents, not the business.**

DDD explicitly **rejects** this model.

---

## 4. DDD’s Collaboration Model

DDD replaces handoffs with **continuous conversation**:

```
Domain Experts ↔ Engineers ↔ Model ↔ Code
```

Key properties:

* no “final requirements”
* shared language
* rapid feedback
* learning-driven design

> **The model evolves through conversation, not specification.**

---

## 5. Ubiquitous Language Is the Contract

Collaboration produces a **Ubiquitous Language**:

* shared terms
* precise meanings
* consistent usage
* reflected in code

Important:

* language is **designed**
* ambiguity is resolved, not tolerated
* disagreements surface early

If people say:

> “Well, it depends what you mean by X…”

That’s a **modeling opportunity**, not a problem.

---

## 6. Conversations Drive Design

### What DDD Conversations Look Like

Good DDD conversations:

* explore scenarios
* focus on edge cases
* uncover implicit rules
* challenge assumptions

Bad conversations:

* focus on screens & APIs
* jump to solutions
* avoid uncomfortable ambiguity

Rule:

> **If you’re not confused, you’re not learning.**

---

## 7. Modeling Workshops (Practical Mechanisms)

DDD uses structured collaboration techniques:

* Event Storming
* Example Mapping
* Domain Storytelling
* Big Picture Modeling

Purpose:

* accelerate shared understanding
* expose hidden complexity
* align mental models

Output is not diagrams — it’s **clarity**.

---

## 8. Why Engineers Must Be Deeply Involved

DDD explicitly rejects:

> “The business defines, engineering implements.”

Because:

* models are design decisions
* trade-offs are technical + business
* boundaries affect performance, cost, and risk

Senior engineers must:

* ask “why”
* challenge rules respectfully
* surface technical constraints early

---

## 9. Common Senior-Level Failure Patterns

❌ Treating domain experts as “requirement providers”
→ They are **co-designers**

❌ Delegating all domain interaction to PM/BA
→ Engineers lose semantic context

❌ Avoiding domain complexity
→ Complexity doesn’t disappear — it leaks

❌ Expecting domain experts to speak “technical”
→ Engineers must learn the business language

---

## 10. Senior Engineer Mindset Shift

As a Senior / Architect:

* Your job is not to *code faster*
* Your job is to *reduce misunderstanding*

You succeed when:

* code mirrors conversation
* changes start with discussion, not tickets
* business trusts the system

---

## 11. Real-World Example

### Failed Collaboration

* “Customer” means different things
* Disputes happen after deployment
* Hotfix-driven development

---

### Effective Collaboration

* Terms are precise
* Rules are explicit
* Disagreements resolved early
* System evolves smoothly

## 🔗 How This Connects Forward

This topic leads directly to:

* **Topic 1.6 – When DDD Makes Sense (and When It Doesn’t)**
* **Ubiquitous Language**
* **Bounded Context**

Without collaboration, DDD collapses into **pattern theater**.
