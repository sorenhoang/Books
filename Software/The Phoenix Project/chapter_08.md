**Chapter 8 Summary**

* **Date:** Monday, September 8.
* **The Resource Pitch:** Bill meets with CEO Steve Masters to present his capacity and demand analysis. He argues that IT is dangerously understaffed and cannot simultaneously deliver on Project Phoenix, daily operations, and the massive SOX-404 audit remediation-.
* **The Rejection:** Bill asks for six additional staff members, but Steve flatly refuses-. Steve explains that Phoenix is $10 million over budget and the company must get cash-flow positive, mandating that Bill "use what you've got" or potentially face further headcount cuts-. Sarah Moulton interrupts and cuts the meeting short before Bill can argue further.
* **The Change Avalanche:** A defeated Bill heads to the Change Advisory Board (CAB) meeting, where he is shocked to find the room completely covered in whiteboards and index cards representing 437 submitted changes for the week-.
* **The Triage System:** Realizing they cannot review hundreds of cards in an hour, Bill, Wes, and Patty establish a new triage system to categorize changes by risk-:
  * **High-Risk (Fragile):** Changes affecting unstable systems (like the notorious PUCCAR app) require strict CAB scrutiny and authorization-.
  * **Low-Risk (Standard):** Routine, well-understood changes are pre-approved and can be scheduled without a full CAB review-.
  * **Medium-Risk:** The person submitting the change is accountable for consulting with anyone potentially affected before bringing it to the CAB for scheduling-.
* **A Small Victory:** The team successfully processes the high-risk changes in record time,. They agree to extend the change amnesty period to process the rest of the cards, marking a significant win for the team's collaboration and the new change process-.
