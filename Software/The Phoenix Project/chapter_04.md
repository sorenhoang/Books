**Chapter 4 Summary**

* **Date:** Wednesday, September 3.
* **Morning Chaos:** Bill arrives early to find 526 new e-mails and 62 voicemails. He attempts to meet with his new assistant, Ellen, but his laptop crashes with a "blue screen of death" due to a security patch deployed by John Pesche’s team—a widespread issue affecting many employees.
* **The Ambush:** Sarah Moulton sends an urgent e-mail accusing Bill of delaying Project Phoenix. This leads to a tense meeting with Steve (CEO), Chris Allers (VP of App Dev), and Sarah.
  * Sarah attacks Bill for a lack of urgency, blaming IT Operations for impeding the company’s survival.
  * Bill defends his team, noting they were fully utilized fixing the payroll outage.
  * **The Reckless Decision:** Despite Wes warning that they lack hardware specifications, test environments, and have not done capacity testing, Chris claims they can deploy Phoenix in one week. Steve, pressured by external commitments to analysts, sides with Sarah and sets the go-live date for **Friday, September 12 at 5 p.m.**.
* **The Change Advisory Board (CAB):** Bill attends his first CAB meeting, expecting a room full of people. Instead, only Patty is there. He learns that the existing change management process is ignored by everyone, including Wes and John, because the tools are too cumbersome.
* **Rebooting Process:** Realizing that the lack of coordination caused the payroll failure, Bill issues a directive: attendance at CAB meetings is now mandatory for all managers, and no changes will be allowed without approval. He schedules a mandatory meeting for Friday.
* **Resistance:** Wes calls Bill to complain, arguing that previous attempts at rigorous change management paralyzed the department with bureaucracy. Bill insists it is necessary to prevent further disasters.
* **The Meeting:** At the Friday meeting, Bill emphasizes the importance of change management and announces that any changes must be approved by the CAB. He also introduces a new change management tool to streamline the process.
* **The Fallout:** The chapter ends with Bill receiving an e-mail from Chris Allers, who is furious about the new change management process, claiming it will slow down development and jeopardize the Phoenix project. Bill realizes he has a long road ahead to get everyone on board with the new process.
