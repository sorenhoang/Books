A business novel following Bill Palmer, an IT manager at Parts Unlimited, as he's unexpectedly promoted to VP of IT Operations during a company crisis. Through his journey, the book teaches DevOps principles, the Three Ways, and how IT can transform from a cost center to a competitive advantage.

## Key Concepts

- **The Three Ways**
  - Flow (left to right) — fast delivery from Dev to Ops to customer
  - Feedback (right to left) — fast detection and recovery
  - Continual Learning — experimentation, practice, improvement

- **The Four Types of Work**
  - Business Projects
  - Internal IT Projects
  - Changes
  - Unplanned Work (the silent killer)

- **Constraints & Bottlenecks** — Theory of Constraints applied to IT (inspired by _The Goal_)

- **WIP Limits** — Too much work-in-progress destroys throughput

- **Brent Problem** — Over-reliance on a single expert creates fragility
