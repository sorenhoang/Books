**Chapter 2 Summary**

- **Date:** Tuesday, September 2.
- **The Payroll Crisis:** Immediately following his promotion, Bill meets with CFO Dick Landry and Finance Operations Manager Ann. A payroll system failure has resulted in missing records for hourly factory workers, threatening a union strike and legal action if not resolved by 5 p.m..
- **The Audit Threat:** Dick is particularly stressed because strict SOX-404 auditors are currently on-site; a manual workaround to pay employees could create a "financial reporting error" and prolong the audit.
- **The NOC:** Bill visits the Network Operations Center (NOC) in Building 7, which he notes is run-down compared to the executive offices. He discovers his new direct reports, Wes (Distributed Tech Ops) and Patty (IT Support), were not informed that Bill is now their boss.
- **The Technical Failure:** The IT team is in chaos, blaming the outage on a Storage Area Network (SAN) firmware upgrade that went wrong the previous night, crashing multiple databases.
- **The "Brent" Problem:** Bill is introduced to **Brent Geller**, a lead engineer who is the only person capable of fixing the most complex issues. Brent was pulled off a critical "Phoenix" task for Sarah Moulton to fix the SAN, highlighting the resource contention in IT.
- **Next Steps:** Bill asserts his authority, sets a 3 p.m. deadline to decide on the payroll fix, and demands a factual investigation into the SAN failure rather than relying on hearsay.
