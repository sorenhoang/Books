**Chapter 5 Summary**

- **Date:** Thursday, September 4.
- **The Wake-up Call:** Bill wakes up to an urgent e-mail from Steve Masters regarding a critical SOX-404 audit finding. He has to rush to an 8 a.m. meeting, annoying his wife by leaving her to handle the morning routine with their children,,.
- **The Audit Meeting:** Bill meets with Nancy Mailer (Chief Audit Executive), John Pesche (CISO), and the external auditors. They present a catastrophic report: **952 IT control deficiencies**, sixteen significant deficiencies, and two potential "material weaknesses",.
  - **The Threat:** If a management response plan isn't submitted by the following Monday, the company risks an "adverse footnote" in its 10-K filing with the SEC, which could severely damage the company's financial standing,.
  - **Key Findings:** The auditors highlight the lack of a functioning change management process (referencing the empty CAB meeting) and developers having administrative access to production systems,.
- **John’s Miscalculation:** John Pesche attempts to grandstand, claiming his team saved the company by tokenizing credit card data. Nancy dismissively informs him that PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is not in the scope of this specific financial audit, rendering his urgent, disruption-causing project irrelevant to this crisis,.
- **The Resource Conflict:** Wes argues that patching the fragile legacy systems to satisfy auditors will cause them to crash. More importantly, they realize that fixing the audit findings will require the same key resources—specifically **Brent**—that are critical for Project Phoenix,.
- **The Realization:** Bill realizes IT Operations has no idea what its actual capacity or commitments are. They are flying blind regarding how much work they have versus how many people can do it,.
- **Next Steps:** Bill directs Wes and Patty to inventory _every_ operational commitment (projects, patches, etc.) and estimate the time required. He intends to use this data to prove to Steve that they are understaffed and cannot do Phoenix, operations, _and_ the audit remediation simultaneously,.
