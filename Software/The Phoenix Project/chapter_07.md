**Chapter 7 Summary**

* **Date:** Friday, September 5.
* **The New Board Member:** Bill is summoned by Steve's assistant to quickly meet with Erik Reid, a prospective board member visiting for the day. Bill is surprised to find that Erik looks and dresses more like a scruffy delivery man than a technology executive.
* **The Critique:** Erik accurately assesses Bill's disastrous situation with Phoenix, the auditors, and the daily outages. He tells Bill that his problem isn't a lack of "rigor and discipline," but rather that Bill doesn't actually know what "work" is.
* **The Plant Tour:** To prove his point, Erik drives Bill to the company's MRP-8 manufacturing plant. From a catwalk overlooking the factory floor, Erik explains that IT Operations has a lot to learn from Plant Operations.
* **WIP and The Bottleneck:** Erik introduces the concept of Work in Process (WIP) as the "silent killer" of production. Referencing the *Theory of Constraints*, he explains that any improvement made anywhere besides the bottleneck is merely an illusion.
* **The Three Ways:** Erik introduces the core principles needed to fix IT: The First Way (fast flow of work from Development to IT Operations), The Second Way (shortening and amplifying feedback loops), and The Third Way (a culture of experimentation, learning from failure, and practice).
* **The Homework:** Erik leaves Bill with a challenge: to figure out the "four types of work" in IT. So far, Bill has only identified one (business projects).
* **The Clunker:** Bill returns to his desk, where his ancient, taped-together replacement laptop emits a piercing alarm that he can only stop by slashing the tape with a letter opener to rip the battery out.
