**Chapter 6 Summary**

- **Date:** Friday, September 5.
- **Phoenix Status:** In the morning status meeting, Bill learns that the developers are further behind than expected, deferring critical testing to the next release. This shifts the burden of finding errors from Quality Assurance (QA) to IT Operations during deployment.
- **Resource Analysis:** Bill meets with Wes and Patty to review the workload inventory. They discover alarming statistics:
  - **Overload:** The team is committed to **35 business projects** and over **70 internal IT projects**.
  - **Capacity:** Most key resources are tied up with Project Phoenix. The **Compliance (Audit)** project alone would consume their key resources for an entire year.
  - **Break-Fix:** Incident recovery and "break-fix" work consume **75%** of the staff's time, taking priority over planned work.
- **The Preventable Outage:** Wes reveals that Brent was pulled off Phoenix work again to fix a SAN (Storage Area Network) outage. The outage was caused by a drive failure that went unaddressed for months because the replacement part was stuck in procurement. Bill is furious that preventable issues are derailing critical projects [203–205].
- **The CAB Meeting:** Bill convenes a Change Advisory Board (CAB) meeting.
  - **Tension:** He walks in on Wes and Patty arguing about an engineer who was fired for a change mistake, while John Pesche (CISO) threatens them with audit repercussions.
  - **New Process:** To bypass the cumbersome software tools nobody uses, Bill implements a manual system using **index cards**. Everyone must write down their planned changes on cards to be visualized on a physical calendar.
  - **Defining "Change":** The group struggles but eventually defines a change as "any activity that is physical, logical, or virtual to applications, databases, operating systems, networks, or hardware that could impact services".
- **The Flood of Work:** By the afternoon, Patty reports that **437 changes** have been submitted for the upcoming week, far exceeding expectations. Realizing they cannot review them all immediately, Bill grants "amnesty" for Monday's changes but requires strict authorization for the rest of the week.
