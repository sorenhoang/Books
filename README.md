# Books Knowledge Base

This repository keeps personal notes and summaries for books I read, organized by category.

## Structure
- Top-level folders group books by category (for example `Software`).
- Each book lives in its own subfolder inside the category.
- Every book folder contains a `README.md` for takeaways, references, and chapter notes.

## Current Library
- `Software`
	- `Designing Data-Intensive Applications`
