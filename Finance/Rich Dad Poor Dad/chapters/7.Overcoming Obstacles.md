### **Chapter Seven Summary: Overcoming Obstacles**

Even after becoming financially literate, individuals often face five specific roadblocks that prevent them from building significant asset columns. These obstacles are fear, cynicism, laziness, bad habits, and arrogance.

#### **1. Overcoming Fear**
The primary difference between the rich and the poor is how they **manage the fear of losing money**. Kiyosaki notes that he has never met a rich person who has not lost money, but he has met many poor people who never have because they never invest.
*   **The Texan Attitude:** Rich Dad encouraged thinking like a Texan—living life big and being proud of both wins and losses. He argued that most people fail financially because they play it "too safe".
*   **Turning Failure into Inspiration:** For winners, losing inspires them; for losers, losing defeats them. To be a winner, one must be unafraid to lose and remain **focused** rather than "balanced" in their investments.

#### **2. Overcoming Cynicism**
Cynics are often described as "Chicken Littles" who paralyze themselves by constantly worrying that "the sky is falling". 
*   **Criticize vs. Analyze:** Cynics criticize, while winners analyze. Analysis allows winners to see opportunities that critics miss because their minds are closed by doubt.
*   **The "Toilets" Example:** Many people avoid real estate because they "don't want to fix toilets". Kiyosaki views this as "noise" that stops progress; a savvy investor simply hires a property manager to handle repairs so they can focus on acquiring more assets.

#### **3. Overcoming Laziness**
The most common form of laziness is **staying busy**. People often use a hectic schedule at work or with family to avoid facing their underlying financial problems or the need to manage their wealth.
*   **The Cure for Laziness:** A little "greed" or desire for a better life is the antidote. 
*   **Changing Internal Dialogue:** Instead of the brain-numbing statement "I can't afford it," you must ask **"How can I afford it?"**. The former shuts the brain down, while the latter forces it to search for solutions and opportunities.

#### **4. Overcoming Bad Habits**
Our lives are reflections of our habits more than our education. 
*   **Pay Yourself First:** While "Poor Dad" paid his bills first and himself last (if anything was left), "Rich Dad" insisted on **paying himself first**, even when short of cash.
*   **Using Pressure as Motivation:** By paying himself first, Rich Dad used the pressure of creditors and the tax man as a motivational tool to force his mind to find new ways to create more income.

#### **5. Overcoming Arrogance**
Kiyosaki defines arrogance as "ego plus ignorance". 
*   **The Danger of Ego:** Many people use arrogance to hide their own ignorance. 
*   **Financial Impact:** Thinking that what you don't know isn't important often leads to losing money. When you realize you are ignorant in a specific field, the correct response is to find an expert or a book to educate yourself.
