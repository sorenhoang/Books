### **Chapter Nine Summary: Still Want More? Here Are Some To Do’s**

While the previous chapters focus on the philosophy of financial intelligence, **Chapter Nine provides a practical "to-do list"** for those ready to take immediate action. Kiyosaki emphasizes that **action always beats inaction**, and he shares the specific habits he uses to find and secure opportunities.

#### **1. Break the Cycle and Seek New Ideas**
*   **Stop doing what you’re doing:** Take a break to assess what is working and what is not. If you are not seeing results, stop the "insanity" of repeating the same actions and look for something new.
*   **Look for new ideas:** Visit bookstores to find "formulas" for unique subjects you know nothing about. For example, Kiyosaki learned about **16 percent tax-lien certificates** simply by reading a book and following its instructions exactly.

#### **2. Leverage the Experience of Others**
*   **Find someone who has done what you want to do:** Take an expert to lunch to learn the "tips and tricks of the trade". Kiyosaki once invited a government employee who invested in tax liens to lunch; she spent the entire afternoon teaching him exactly how to find the best deals.
*   **Invest in education:** Continue attending classes and seminars. Kiyosaki attributes his wealth and freedom to the courses he took, noting that many of his friends who refused to "waste money" on seminars remain stuck in the same jobs.

#### **3. Mastering the Market**
*   **Make lots of offers:** Do not worry about knowing the "right" price immediately; that is the real estate agent's job. You only find the true market value when a second party is willing to deal. 
*   **Use escape clauses:** When making offers on real estate, include **contingencies** (such as the approval of a "business partner") to allow yourself a way out if you decide the deal isn't right after it is accepted. 
*   **Treat investing like dating:** You must go to the market, talk to many people, make multiple offers, and negotiate. Search, offer, reject, and negotiate are all fundamental parts of the process.

#### **4. Identifying Opportunities**
*   **Observe a specific area:** Jog, walk, or drive through a neighborhood you are interested in once a month. Repetition allows you to notice slight changes—such as "For Sale" signs that have been up too long or new retailers moving in—that signal a **profitable opportunity**.
*   **Shop for bargains in all markets:** Most consumers run toward a sale on toilet paper but run *away* from a stock market crash. Savvy investors remember that **profits are made in the buying, not in the selling**.
*   **Think Big:** Instead of looking for what you can afford, "buy the pie and cut it into pieces". For example, you can tie up a large piece of land with an option, find other buyers for parts of it, and keep the remaining portion for yourself for free.

**Key Mindset for Chapter Nine:**
Kiyosaki highlights that small thinkers remain small because they act alone or do not act at all. By developing a "to-do" mindset and focusing on **volume and repetition**, you train your mind to see the gold that others are not trained to see.
