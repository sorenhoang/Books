### **Chapter Six Summary: Lesson 6—Work to Learn—Don’t Work for Money**

This chapter explores the necessity of **broadening your skill set** rather than specializing in one specific field. The sources explain that while the educational system and "Poor Dad" encourage specialization to earn more money, "Rich Dad" advocated for **"knowing a little about a lot"** to understand how a whole business system functions.

#### **The "Best-Selling" vs. "Best-Writing" Author**
The chapter opens with Kiyosaki interviewing a talented reporter in Singapore. She was a brilliant writer but struggled financially. When Kiyosaki suggested she attend a **sales-training course** to help her books sell, she became offended, claiming a professional with a master's degree shouldn't "stoop so low" as to learn sales. Kiyosaki pointed out that his own books are labeled **"best-selling" author**, not "best-writing" author, emphasizing that her great writing was only half the formula for success.

#### **"One Skill Away" from Wealth**
The sources state that many talented, highly educated people earn very little because they lack one or two vital business skills. Kiyosaki notes that financial intelligence is a **synergy of accounting, investing, marketing, and law**; without the ability to sell or market, technical brilliance often goes unrewarded. 

#### **Kiyosaki’s Career Strategy**
Kiyosaki provides examples of how he chose his own jobs based on what he would **learn**, not what he would earn:
*   **Standard Oil:** He learned international trade and the logistics of large ships. 
*   **The Marine Corps:** He joined to learn **leadership**, which Rich Dad argued was essential for managing people in business. 
*   **Xerox Corp:** He joined specifically to overcome his **fear of rejection** and learn how to sell, as Xerox had one of the best sales-training programs in the country.

#### **The Danger of Specialization**
While "Poor Dad" believed in the prestige of a PhD and specialized knowledge, "Rich Dad" warned that the more specialized you become, the more you are **trapped and dependent** on that specific industry. The sources suggest that if a highly specialized person (like a pilot or teacher) loses their job, their skills may not easily transfer to other fields, which is why such professionals often require **union protection**.

#### **Key Management Skills for Success**
Kiyosaki identifies three primary management skills necessary for success:
1.  Management of **cash flow**.
2.  Management of **systems**.
3.  Management of **people**.

The sources conclude that to be truly rich, one must also master the law of **"Give, and you shall receive,"** noting that both of Kiyosaki's dads were generous teachers, but only the Rich Dad understood the power of being **charitable with money** to receive more in return.

**Analogy for Understanding Skills Synergy:**
The sources use the example of a **McDonald's hamburger**. Most people can cook a better hamburger than McDonald's, but McDonald's makes more money because they have mastered the **business system** of selling and delivering that burger. Being a "best-writing" author is like having a "best burger"; without the "best-selling" system, you remain a talented person who is simply struggling to find a market.
