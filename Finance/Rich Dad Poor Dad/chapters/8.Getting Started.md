### **Chapter Eight Summary: Getting Started**

This chapter provides a practical **ten-step process** to awaken your "financial genius," a power the sources claim every individual possesses but which often lies dormant due to traditional schooling and cultural conditioning. Kiyosaki argues that "there is gold everywhere," but most people are not trained to see it.

#### **1. Find a Reason Greater Than Reality (The Power of Spirit)**
To succeed, you must have a deep emotional purpose—a combination of **"wants" and "don't wants"**. 
*   **Don't wants:** Working all your life, being an employee, or having the government take your wealth at death.
*   **Wants:** Freedom to travel, control over your time, and having money work for you. 
Without a strong enough "why," the challenges of the road to wealth will seem like too much work.

#### **2. Make Daily Choices (The Power of Choice)**
Financially, every dollar in your hand is a choice to be rich, poor, or middle class.
*   **Invest first in education:** The mind is your only real asset. 
*   **Time management:** Choose what you put in your head (e.g., attending seminars or reading business books instead of watching TV).
*   **Listening vs. Talking:** Truly intelligent people listen to absorb new ideas rather than arguing to defend old ones.

#### **3. Choose Friends Carefully (The Power of Association)**
Kiyosaki suggests learning from everyone, including those who struggle financially (to see what *not* to do). 
*   **Avoid "Chicken Littles":** Do not listen to poor or frightened people who always claim "the sky is falling" regarding investments. 
*   **Wealthy Friends:** Seek friends who talk about money and have "insider" information on market trends to help you get in before the next boom.

#### **4. Master a Formula and Then Learn a New One (The Power of Learning Quickly)**
"You become what you study". Most people follow the formula of "working for money". Kiyosaki suggests mastering unique formulas (like foreclosure investing) and then moving on to new ones. In a fast-changing world, **how fast you learn** is a priceless skill.

#### **5. Pay Yourself First (The Power of Self-Discipline)**
This is the most difficult step to master. 
*   **Self-discipline** is the primary delineator between the rich and the poor. 
*   **Management skills:** You must manage your **cash flow, people, and personal time**. 
*   **The Rule:** Allocate money to your asset column every month *before* paying bills. Use the pressure of bill collectors to inspire your financial genius to create more income rather than dipping into your savings.

#### **6. Pay Your Brokers Well (The Power of Good Advice)**
Rich Dad believed in paying professionals well. A good broker is your "eyes and ears" in the market and provides priceless information that can make you much more money than their commission costs.

#### **7. Be an "Indian Giver" (The Power of Getting Something for Nothing)**
Sophisticated investors ask, **"How fast do I get my money back?"**. Once the initial investment is returned, you should aim to keep an asset that was technically free (a "piece of the action") to continue generating cash flow.

#### **8. Use Assets to Buy Luxuries (The Power of Focus)**
Do not buy luxuries on credit or by dipping into savings. Use your desire for a "toy" (like a new car) to motivate your financial genius to **create an asset** that generates enough cash flow to pay for that luxury.

#### **9. Choose Heroes (The Power of Myth)**
Emulate heroes like Warren Buffett or Donald Trump. Heroes make investing look easy, which convinces you that you can do it too. By acting with their "bravado" or analytical style, you tap into a source of raw genius.

#### **10. Teach and You Shall Receive (The Power of Giving)**
"If you want something, you first need to give". Kiyosaki advocates for the principle of reciprocity: if you want money, give money; if you want sales, help someone else sell. Being generous with what you know and what you have makes you smarter and attracts more abundance.
