### **Chapter Five Summary: Lesson 5—The Rich Invent Money**

This chapter emphasizes that in the real world, it is often **the bold who get ahead rather than just the "smart"**,. Kiyosaki argues that every person possesses a "financial genius" that is often suppressed by self-doubt and excessive fear,.

#### **Financial Intelligence as "Options"**
Kiyosaki defines financial intelligence as having **more options**. If opportunities do not come your way, financial intelligence is the ability to improve your position; if a deal lands in your lap but you have no money, it is the ability to make that deal work anyway. He suggests that wealth in the Information Age is based on **timely information**, and the mind is the single most powerful asset we have,.

#### **The CASHFLOW Game**
To teach these concepts, Kiyosaki uses a board game he invented called **CASHFLOW**. The game is designed to provide "instant feedback" on how a player handles money and identifies opportunities,. He observes that players who get out of the "Rat Race" the fastest are those who understand numbers and have creative financial minds.

#### **Inventing Money: Practical Examples**
Kiyosaki provides personal examples of how he "invented" money by seeing opportunities others missed:
*   **The Phoenix Deal:** During a depressed market, he bought a house for **$20,000** through a bankruptcy attorney’s office using a **$2,000 loan** for the down payment. He advertised it for $60,000 with "no money down." Within five hours of total work, he created a **$40,000 promissory note** in his asset column, which generated $4,000 a year in cash flow,.
*   **The Portland Deal:** He purchased a small house for **$45,000** (worth $65,000) and sold it a year later for **$95,000**,. He used a **1031 tax-deferred exchange** to move those gains into a 12-unit apartment building, and eventually into a 30-unit building in Phoenix,.

#### **Two Types of Investors**
The chapter distinguishes between two types of investors:
1.  **The Package Buyer:** Those who buy a prepared investment from a retail outlet (like a mutual fund or a REIT).
2.  **The Professional Investor:** Those who **create investments** by assembling the deal themselves. To be this second type, you must develop three skills: finding an opportunity everyone else missed, raising money without a bank, and organizing smart people,,.

#### **The Four Pillars of Financial Intelligence**
To be successful in "inventing" money, one must master the synergy of four technical skills,:
*   **Accounting:** Financial literacy and the ability to read numbers.
*   **Investing:** The science of "money making money".
*   **Understanding Markets:** The science of supply and demand.
*   **The Law:** Awareness of state and federal regulations and the tax advantages of corporations.

Kiyosaki concludes that **great opportunities are seen with the mind, not the eyes**, and that winners are those who are not afraid of losing or making mistakes,.
