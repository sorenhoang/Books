### **Chapter Three Summary: Lesson 3—Mind Your Own Business**

This chapter focuses on the third secret of the rich: **minding your own business**. Kiyosaki argues that most people struggle financially because they spend their lives minding someone else's business and making that person rich.

#### **The Ray Kroc Story**
In 1974, Ray Kroc, the founder of **McDonald’s**, was asked to speak to an MBA class at the University of Texas. He asked the students, "What business am I in?" After they laughed and replied that he was obviously in the hamburger business, Kroc corrected them: **"Ladies and gentlemen, I’m not in the hamburger business. My business is real estate"**. 

He explained that while the franchises sold hamburgers, the primary focus of his business plan was the **real estate** under each location. He knew that the land and its location were the most significant factors in the success of each franchise. Today, McDonald’s is the largest single owner of real estate in the world.

#### **Profession vs. Business**
Kiyosaki emphasizes a vital distinction between your **profession** and your **business**:
*   **Your Profession:** This is what you do for your income column (e.g., being a banker, lawyer, or chef).
*   **Your Business:** This revolves around your **asset column**.

The mistake many people make is that they "become what they study" and forget to mind their own business. To become financially secure, you must focus on building and keeping your asset column strong rather than just focusing on a higher salary.

#### **What Kind of Assets to Acquire?**
Kiyosaki suggests that "real assets" fall into categories that put money in your pocket without requiring your physical presence. These include:
*   **Businesses that do not require your presence:** They are managed by others; if you have to work there, it is a job, not a business.
*   **Stocks and Bonds.**
*   **Income-generating real estate.**
*   **Notes (IOUs).**
*   **Royalties** from intellectual property (music, patents, etc.).
*   **Anything else** that has value, produces income, or appreciates.

He personalizes this by explaining that he collects real estate because he loves buildings and land, and he invests in small-cap stocks because he is an entrepreneur at heart.

#### **Luxuries and Financial Discipline**
A major difference between the rich and the poor is how they handle luxuries. The poor and middle class often buy luxuries (big houses, furs, jewelry, boats) **first** on credit to "look rich". This often results in them resenting the luxury as the debt becomes a burden.

In contrast, **the rich buy luxuries last**. They use the income generated from their assets to buy their "toys". For example, when Kiyosaki’s wife, Kim, wanted a Mercedes, she waited four years until her apartment houses generated enough extra cash flow to pay for it. The luxury was a reward for using her financial intelligence to grow her asset column.

#### **The "Employee" Dollar**
Kiyosaki suggests a shift in how you view money: **once a dollar goes into your asset column, never let it come out**. Think of every dollar as a **great employee** that works 24 hours a day for generations to make more "employees" and buy the boss a Porsche with before-tax dollars.

**Summary Mindset:**
Most people work for the company (for salary), then the government (for taxes), and then the bank (for the mortgage). By minding your own business and focusing on assets, you ensure your efforts benefit you and your family directly.
