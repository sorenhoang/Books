### **Chapter Four Summary: Lesson 4—The History of Taxes and the Power of Corporations**

In this chapter, Kiyosaki explains the "biggest secret of the rich": using **corporations** to protect wealth and minimize tax burdens. He contrasts his two fathers' views on taxes, illustrating how a lack of financial education traps the middle class into paying for everyone else.

#### **The Robin Hood Myth**
Kiyosaki grew up with the story of Robin Hood, but his Rich Dad viewed the character as a **crook** rather than a hero. Rich Dad argued that the "tax the rich" sentiment—often called the Robin Hood theory of economics—actually caused the most pain for the poor and middle class. While the masses voted for taxes intended to punish the rich, the government’s growing appetite for money eventually required levying taxes on the middle class and lower-income levels.

#### **A Brief History of Taxes**
Kiyosaki notes that originally, there were no permanent income taxes in England or America; they were only levied temporarily to pay for wars, such as the fight against Napoleon or the American Civil War. It wasn't until the **16th Amendment** in 1913 that income tax became permanent in the United States. This was only accepted because the public believed it would only punish the wealthy.

#### **Government Bureaucrats vs. Capitalists**
The two fathers had opposing views on government spending:
*   **Poor Dad (The Bureaucrat):** Believed the government should help people. In the government, success is measured by how much money you spend and how many people you hire; if you don't spend your budget, you risk losing it.
*   **Rich Dad (The Capitalist):** Viewed government workers as a "pack of lazy thieves". In his business, success was measured by efficiency: hiring fewer people and spending less money to maximize investor respect.

#### **The Advantage of the Corporation**
Rich Dad outsmarted the tax system by using **corporations**, a legal structure that provides a vast advantage over individuals. Kiyosaki clarifies that a corporation is not a building or a factory; it is simply a **file folder with legal documents** registered with a state agency. 

The primary power of a corporation lies in the **sequence of spending**:
*   **An Employee:** Earns money → Gets taxed → Lives on what is left.
*   **A Business Owner with a Corporation:** Earns money → Spends everything it can (legitimate expenses) → Gets taxed only on what remains.

By owning a corporation, the rich can pay for "board meetings" in vacation spots like Hawaii, car insurance, repairs, and health-club memberships with **pre-tax dollars**.

#### **Protection and Legal Loopholes**
The rich also use corporations to protect themselves from a litigious society. They often **"control everything, but own nothing,"** hiding wealth in trusts and corporations to shield it from creditors. Kiyosaki also highlights specific tax advantages like **Section 1031**, which allows investors to delay paying taxes on real estate gains if they trade up for a more expensive property.

#### **The Four Components of Financial IQ**
Kiyosaki identifies four broad areas of expertise that constitute a high Financial IQ, with this chapter focusing heavily on the fourth:
1.  **Accounting:** The ability to read and understand financial statements.
2.  **Investing:** The science of "money making money".
3.  **Understanding Markets:** The science of supply and demand.
4.  **The Law:** Understanding tax advantages and legal protections provided by corporations.

**The "Employee" Analogy:**
Kiyosaki describes the uninformed employee as a **"docile cow ready for milking"**. While the employee works hard to climb the corporate ladder, they give the power to their employer and the tax man. Rich Dad’s advice was simple: **"Why not own the ladder?"**. By owning the corporation, you keep the power and ensure that every dollar in your asset column is a **"great employee"** working 24 hours a day to build more wealth for the boss.
